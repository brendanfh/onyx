A basic IR is going to be needed for the C compilation of Onyx. I've never done
this before so the following are just some thoughts that have no proof of working.

The IR instructions will be based on a 3 address code with an unlimited number
of temporaries that will (probably) be allocated in a SSA form.

Some of the IR instructions I think will be necessary:

    - Immediate Load for different types
    - Binary Operator 3 address code
    - Unary Operator 2 address code
    - Memory store for different types
    - Memory load for different types
    - Call
    - Foreign Call
